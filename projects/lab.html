    <h1>Naval Health Research Center</h1>
    <h2>Laboratory Information Management System</h2>
    <h3>Designed and programmed by: Tom Gao (2009-2013)</h3>
    <p>Purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li >To aid Laboratory testing and digital reporting VIA pulling machine outputs and automatically input into SQL server </li>
        <ul>
            <li >4 Different BSL-2 / BSL-3 Labs were using the software I created: Enteric, Bacteriology, Virology, Molecular</li>
        </ul>
        <li >To index over 15 years of testing data and patient case data in a secure SQL server</li>
        <li >To aid in Laboratory supply ordering and track inventory, as well as shipment tracking numbers</li>
        <li >To scan paper (hand filed) forms via OCR and record data into an easily accessed SQL database / File repository</li>
        <li >To aid in Laboratory supply ordering by tracking inventory, tracking numbers, and estimated time of delivery</li>
        <li >To generate final test reports to send out to clientele (hospital and military bases)</li>
        <li >Verification of results through intelligent validation code, which would aid laboratory supervisors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This was my biggest body of work during my career at the Naval Health Research Center. I am also the proudest of this accomplishment because it pushed my skills and limits in a positive manner. I felt responsible for tackling a lot of problems that no one before me had the solution to.</p>
    <p>When I first came onboard, I noticed the company&rsquo;s technology was severely lacking. Most data entry was recorded on paper, or Excel files located in an obscure location on some random employee&rsquo;s local hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>My first line of duty was to bring all of the processes and important information up to date in a modern platform that allowed this information to be: stored securely, easily input, and accessible across the department.</p>
    <p>It was no easy task as I spent the entire 4 &frac12; years building an ever-evolving database application to accomplish this. This project was over 40,000 lines of code, custom crystal reports, 40 different custom coded Stored Procedure calls, various 3rd party libraries for OCR form scanning and label printing.</p>
    <p>In the end, I was happy with the result and my accumulated work. The proudest moment was when I was told by an employee of 15 years of the department that,&nbsp;&ldquo;they had been waiting for someone to come along and finally change everything.&rdquo; (in regards to their information technology)</p>
